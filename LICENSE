License Information

Licensor grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license under Licensor's copyrights in the Licensed Work, solely to use, test, perform, and display the Licensed Work in accordance with this License.


Grant of Rights

Licensor grants you the rights to copy, modify, create derivative works, use, and display the Licensed Work, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this License.

You may not offer the Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted basis without a Commercial License.

You may not (a) use the Licensed Work for a Commercial Service, or (b) use the Licensed Work with software that is licensed under only the GNU GPL version 3, without a Commercial License.

You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the Licensed Work.

You must include a copy of this License with all copies or substantial portions of the Licensed Work.

You may not use the Licensed Work, except as expressly permitted under this License. If you violate this License, your rights under this License, and the license granted by Licensor, will terminate automatically.

The Licensed Work is provided "as is". Licensor hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

Limitation of Liability

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Licensor be liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Licensed Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Termination

This License and your rights under it will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. You may not cure such an occurrence, but you may terminate this License as described above.

Survival of Provisions, but Not License

The provisions of this License intended to survive, such as, but not limited to, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and limitations of remedy, shall continue in effect beyond the termination of this License. However, you may not continue to use, modify, or distribute the Licensed Work except under the Change License or a Commercial License.

Nothing in this License shall be deemed to create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between Licensor and you, or to grant Licensor power to bind you to any obligation aside from the performance of the obligations, promises, conditions, and covenants set forth in this License.

Commercial License

Your ability to commercially use the Licensed Work, including without limitation, the ability to resell, rent, lease, redistribute, host or otherwise make it available to third parties, may be restricted by the patent claims you own, directly or indirectly, against the Licensed Work itself.

Your rights to use the Licensed Work under this License terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from the Licensor is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the Licensor explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the Licensor fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from the Licensor is reinstated permanently if the Licensor fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from the Licensor, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Disclaimer of Warranty

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
